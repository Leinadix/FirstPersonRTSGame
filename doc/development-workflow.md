## Development Environment

### Required Tools

- **.NET 6.0 SDK** or newer
- **Visual Studio 2022**, **Visual Studio Code**, or another compatible IDE
- **Git** for version control

### Recommended Extensions and Tools

For Visual Studio:
- **ReSharper** or **Visual Studio IntelliCode** for code quality and suggestions
- **Visual Studio Test Explorer** for running and debugging tests

For Visual Studio Code:
- **C# for Visual Studio Code** extension
- **.NET Core Test Explorer** extension
- **GitLens** for better Git integration

## Branching Strategy

The project follows a simplified Git Flow branching strategy:

### Main Branches

- **main**: Contains production-ready code, always stable
- **develop**: Integration branch for ongoing development

### Supporting Branches

- **feature/[feature-name]**: For developing new features
- **bugfix/[bug-name]**: For fixing bugs
- **refactor/[refactor-name]**: For code refactoring
- **docs/[docs-name]**: For documentation updates
- **release/[version]**: For release preparation

### Workflow

1. Create a new branch from `develop` for your feature, bugfix, or other change
2. Implement your changes, writing tests as you go
3. Push your branch and create a pull request to `develop`
4. Address code review feedback
5. Once approved, merge your branch into `develop`
6. Periodically, `develop` is merged into `main` for releases

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Follow C# coding conventions from Microsoft
- Use meaningful and descriptive names
- Keep methods and classes focused on a single responsibility
- Document public APIs with XML comments
- Write self-documenting code when possible

### Project Structure

- **Engine Project**: Contains interfaces and game-agnostic code
- **Game Project**: Contains game-specific implementations
- **Tests Project**: Contains unit and integration tests

### Naming Conventions

- **Interfaces**: Prefix with "I" (e.g., `IShip`)
- **Classes**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `ShipFactory`)
- **Methods**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `GetNearestResource`)
- **Properties**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `Position`)
- **Private Fields**: Use camelCase with underscore prefix (e.g., `_shipFactory`)
- **Local Variables**: Use camelCase (e.g., `nearestShip`)
- **Constants**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `MaxShipSpeed`)

### Code Formatting

- Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
- Keep lines under 120 characters
- Use a single blank line to separate logical groups of code
- Use braces for all control structures, even one-liners
- Place opening braces on the same line as the declaration
- Place else statements on a new line

```csharp
// Good
if (condition)
{
    DoSomething();
}
else
{
    DoSomethingElse();
}

// Avoid
if (condition) { DoSomething(); }
else { DoSomethingElse(); }
```

### Error Handling

- Use exceptions for exceptional conditions, not for control flow
- Catch specific exceptions, not general ones when possible
- Log exceptions with contextual information
- Clean up resources in finally blocks or use `using` statements

## Development Process

### Feature Development

1. **Planning**: Create a detailed description of the feature
2. **Design**: Outline the architecture and interfaces for the feature
3. **Implementation**: Write code and tests
4. **Testing**: Ensure all tests pass and the feature works as expected
5. **Code Review**: Submit for review and address feedback
6. **Integration**: Merge into the develop branch

### Bug Fixes

1. **Reproduction**: Create a reliable test case that reproduces the bug
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify why the bug is occurring
3. **Fix Implementation**: Make the necessary changes
4. **Verification**: Ensure the bug is fixed and no regressions are introduced
5. **Code Review**: Submit for review and address feedback
6. **Integration**: Merge into the develop branch

## Code Review Process

### Submitting for Review

1. Push your branch to the repository
2. Create a pull request to the `develop` branch
3. Fill out the pull request template with:
   - Description of changes
   - Related issue numbers
   - Testing performed
   - Screenshots or videos if applicable

### Review Criteria

Pull requests are evaluated based on:
- Code quality and adherence to standards
- Test coverage
- Performance considerations
- Documentation
- Fulfillment of requirements

### Review Process

1. Reviewer examines code changes
2. Reviewer leaves comments on specific lines or the overall PR
3. Author addresses feedback or explains why changes shouldn't be made
4. Reviewer approves or requests additional changes
5. Once approved, the PR can be merged

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- All new features must have unit tests
- All bug fixes must have regression tests
- Critical systems should have integration tests
- UI components should have suitable tests

### Test Quality

- Tests should be isolated and not depend on other tests
- Tests should be deterministic (always give the same result)
- Tests should be fast to encourage frequent testing
- Tests should focus on behavior, not implementation details

## Documentation Guidelines

### Code Documentation

- Document all public APIs with XML comments
- Explain "why" in comments, not just "what"
- Keep comments up to date when code changes
- Use inline comments sparingly, only for complex sections

### Project Documentation

- Update README.md with new features or changed behavior
- Document architecture decisions in appropriate documents
- Update user guide with new features
- Keep API reference up to date

## Release Process

### Pre-Release Checklist

- All tests pass on all supported platforms
- Documentation is up to date
- Release notes are prepared
- Performance and stability verified

### Release Steps

1. Create a release branch from develop
2. Perform final tests and fixes on the release branch
3. Update version numbers and changelog
4. Merge the release branch into main
5. Tag the release on main
6. Merge the release branch back into develop
7. Publish release artifacts

## Roadmap

### Short-term Goals (Next 3 Months)

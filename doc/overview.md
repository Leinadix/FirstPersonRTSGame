# FirstPersonRTSGame - Project Overview

## Introduction

FirstPersonRTSGame is a prototype 3D real-time strategy game with first-person controls, built using C# and Silk.NET. The project aims to combine the immersive experience of first-person games with the strategic elements of RTS games, creating a unique hybrid gameplay experience.

## Vision and Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

1. Create an immersive first-person experience within an RTS framework
2. Implement intuitive resource management and building construction
3. Develop autonomous unit AI for ships and other entities
4. Build a clean, extensible architecture for future development
5. Create an appealing visual experience with modern OpenGL techniques

## Architecture Overview

The FirstPersonRTSGame is structured with a clear separation of concerns, dividing the codebase into three primary projects:

### Engine Project

The Engine project (`FirstPersonRTSGame.Engine`) contains core game systems and interfaces that are game-agnostic. This includes:

- Rendering systems using OpenGL via Silk.NET
- Input handling abstractions
- Game object interfaces (IShip, IPlayer, IWorld, etc.)
- Constants and utility classes
- Core math and physics functionality

The Engine project defines the interfaces and systems that form the foundation of the game but doesn't implement game-specific logic.

### Game Project

The Game project (`FirstPersonRTSGame.Game`) contains concrete implementations of game objects and game-specific logic. This includes:

- Building implementations (Headquarters, Shipyard, etc.)
- Ship implementations with AI state machines
- Resource implementation and management
- Player controls and interaction
- World generation and management
- UI system implementation

The Game project leverages the interfaces and systems provided by the Engine project to create the actual game experience.

### Tests Project

The Tests project (`FirstPersonRTSGame.Tests`) contains unit and integration tests for the game components, ensuring functionality works as expected. This includes:

- UI component tests
- Game logic tests
- Player interaction tests
- World simulation tests

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used

- **C# and .NET 6.0**: The core programming language and framework
- **Silk.NET**: Used for window management, input handling, and OpenGL binding
- **OpenGL**: The graphics API used for rendering
- **XUnit**: The testing framework used for unit and integration tests
- **Moq**: Used for mocking dependencies in tests

### Rendering Pipeline

The game uses a custom OpenGL-based rendering pipeline with the following components:

1. **Terrain Rendering**: Procedurally generated terrain with height-based texturing
2. **Water Rendering**: Dynamic water surface with reflections and animations
3. **Entity Rendering**: 3D models for ships, buildings, and resources
4. **UI Rendering**: Custom UI system with panels, text, and interactive elements
5. **Post-processing**: Visual effects like bloom and ambient occlusion

### Game Systems

Key game systems include:

1. **Resource Management**: Gathering, storing, and utilizing different resource types
2. **Building System**: Placing, constructing, and operating various buildings
3. **Ship AI**: State machine-driven autonomous behavior for ships
4. **Player Controller**: First-person movement and interaction
5. **UI System**: Interactive UI elements for game interaction

## Data Flow

The general data flow in the application is:

1. User input is captured via Silk.NET
2. The Game class processes input and updates the game state
3. Game objects (World, Player, Ships, etc.) are updated
4. The rendering system visualizes the current game state
5. UI elements display relevant information to the player
6. The cycle repeats for each frame

## Project Structure

The codebase follows a clean architecture approach with:

- **Interfaces**: Defined in the Engine project
- **Implementations**: Provided in the Game project
- **Tests**: Validating both Engine and Game components

## Future Development

The project roadmap includes:

1. Expanded building and ship types
2. Enhanced AI behaviors
3. Multiplayer capabilities
4. Advanced visual effects
5. More complex resource chains and economy
6. Combat mechanics and unit specialization

## Common Build Issues

### Missing Dependencies

**Issue**: Build fails with errors about missing dependencies or packages.

**Solution**:
1. Restore NuGet packages: `dotnet restore --force`
2. Check that your .NET SDK version matches the project requirements
3. Make sure all project references are correct in the .csproj files
4. Verify that required packages are listed in the project file

### Compiler Errors

**Issue**: Build fails with compiler errors in the code.

**Solution**:
1. Check the error messages for specific information about the issue
2. Verify that all required namespaces are properly imported
3. Make sure interface implementations include all required members
4. Check for type mismatches in method calls or assignments
5. Review recent changes that might have introduced the error

### Project Reference Issues

**Issue**: Build fails with errors about invalid project references or circular dependencies.

**Solution**:
1. Check the project structure to ensure there are no circular dependencies
2. Verify that project reference paths are correct (relative or absolute)
3. Make sure the referenced projects are part of the solution
4. Try cleaning and rebuilding the solution
5. Check the build output for specific project reference errors

```bash
# Clean and rebuild the solution
dotnet clean
dotnet build
```

## Runtime Errors

### Null Reference Exceptions

**Issue**: Game crashes with NullReferenceException during gameplay.

**Solution**:
1. Check the exception stack trace to identify the source of the null reference
2. Verify that objects are properly initialized before use
3. Add null checks for parameters and variables
4. Ensure that required dependencies are properly injected
5. Review object lifecycle to ensure objects aren't being accessed after disposal

### ArgumentException or ArgumentNullException

**Issue**: Game crashes with ArgumentException or ArgumentNullException.

**Solution**:
1. Identify the method call causing the exception
2. Check the parameter values being passed to the method
3. Add parameter validation at the beginning of methods
4. Verify that collections are not empty when iterating through them
5. Make sure resource paths are correct and files exist

### OpenGL/Graphics Exceptions

**Issue**: Game crashes with OpenGL-related exceptions during rendering.

**Solution**:
1. Verify that your graphics drivers are up to date
2. Check that your GPU supports OpenGL 3.3 or higher
3. Verify that textures and shaders are being loaded correctly
4. Look for buffer overflows or underflows in rendering code
5. Ensure that OpenGL resources are properly initialized before use
6. Check for proper cleanup of OpenGL resources to avoid leaks

## Performance Issues

### Low Frame Rate

**Issue**: Game runs with a low frame rate or stutters.

**Solution**:
1. Check the system requirements and verify your hardware meets them
2. Close other applications consuming system resources
3. Lower graphical settings if available
4. Profile the game to identify performance bottlenecks
5. Look for memory leaks or excessive garbage collection
6. Optimize rendering code, particularly for large meshes
7. Reduce the number of game objects if possible

### Memory Leaks

**Issue**: Game's memory usage continuously increases over time.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure all disposable resources are properly disposed
2. Check for event handlers that are not being unsubscribed
3. Use the Visual Studio Memory Profiler to identify memory leaks
4. Look for collections that grow without bounds
5. Verify that temporary objects are not being stored in long-lived collections

```csharp
// Proper disposal pattern for OpenGL resources
public void Dispose()
{
    // Delete shaders
    gl.DeleteProgram(shader);
    
    // Delete buffers
    gl.DeleteBuffer(vbo);
    gl.DeleteVertexArray(vao);
    
    // Delete textures
    gl.DeleteTexture(texture);
}
```

## Graphics Issues

### Missing Textures

**Issue**: Game objects appear without textures or with incorrect textures.

**Solution**:
1. Verify that texture files exist in the expected locations
2. Check texture loading code for errors
3. Make sure texture coordinates are correctly assigned
4. Verify that texture filtering and wrapping modes are set correctly
5. Check shader code for texture sampling issues

### Rendering Artifacts

**Issue**: Visual artifacts appear during rendering, such as flickering or z-fighting.

**Solution**:
1. Check for incorrect depth buffer settings
2. Verify that near and far planes for the camera are appropriately set
3. Add small offsets to co-planar surfaces to prevent z-fighting
4. Ensure proper culling settings for transparent objects
5. Check shader code for precision issues

### Incorrect Lighting

**Issue**: Objects appear too dark, too bright, or with incorrect lighting.

**Solution**:
1. Verify light positions and intensities
2. Check normal vectors for consistency and normalization
3. Review shader code for lighting calculations
4. Ensure material properties are correctly set
5. Check for ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting components

## Input/Control Issues

### Unresponsive Controls

**Issue**: Game doesn't respond to keyboard or mouse input.

**Solution**:
1. Verify that the game window has focus
2. Check input handling code for errors
3. Make sure input devices are properly initialized
4. Test different input methods if available
5. Check for modal UI elements that might be blocking input

### Incorrect Camera Movement

**Issue**: Camera movement is inverted, too fast, or too slow.

**Solution**:
1. Verify mouse sensitivity settings
2. Check for inverted axis settings
3. Adjust movement speed constants
4. Verify that delta time is being used for movement calculations
5. Check for collision detection issues that might be blocking movement

```csharp
// Proper movement calculation using delta time
public void Update(float deltaTime)
{
    // Calculate movement based on input
    Vector3 movement = inputDirection * speed * deltaTime;
    
    // Apply movement
    position += movement;
}
```

## Testing Issues

### Failed Tests

**Issue**: Unit or integration tests are failing.

**Solution**:
1. Review test output to identify the specific failing tests
2. Check if tests are using correct test doubles
3. Verify that mock objects are properly set up
4. Ensure test environment is properly initialized
5. Check if recent code changes might have broken existing functionality
6. Update tests if requirements have changed

### Inconsistent Test Results

**Issue**: Tests pass sometimes and fail others without code changes.

**Solution**:
1. Look for race conditions or timing issues
2. Check for test dependencies on global state
3. Verify that tests clean up after themselves
4. Ensure tests don't depend on the order of execution
5. Check for hardcoded paths or environment dependencies

## Development Environment Issues

### Visual Studio/IDE Issues

**Issue**: IDE crashes, freezes, or shows incorrect information.

**Solution**:
1. Restart the IDE
2. Clear IDE caches and temporary files
3. Reinstall or repair the IDE installation
4. Update to the latest IDE version
5. Check for conflicting extensions or plugins

### Source Control Issues

**Issue**: Git merge conflicts or other source control problems.

**Solution**:
1. Pull latest changes before making your own
2. Resolve merge conflicts carefully, testing after each resolution
3. Use proper branching strategy to minimize conflicts
4. Communicate with team members about major changes
5. Consider using Git tools with better merge resolution capabilities

## Advanced Debugging Techniques

### Using the Visual Studio Debugger

1. Set breakpoints at critical sections
2. Use conditional breakpoints for specific scenarios
3. Inspect variable values during execution
4. Use the Immediate Window to evaluate expressions
5. Check the Call Stack to understand execution flow

### Logging and Diagnostics

1. Add detailed logging throughout the codebase
2. Use different log levels (Debug, Info, Warning, Error)
3. Include contextual information in log messages
4. Use a structured logging approach
5. Analyze logs to identify patterns in failures

```csharp
// Simple logging system
public void LogError(string message, Exception ex = null)
{
    string logMessage = $"[ERROR] {DateTime.Now}: {message}";
    if (ex != null)
    {
        logMessage += $" | Exception: {ex.Message} | Stack Trace: {ex.StackTrace}";
    }
    Console.WriteLine(logMessage);
    File.AppendAllText("game_log.txt", logMessage + Environment.NewLine);
}
```

### Performance Profiling

1. Use the Visual Studio Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks
2. Check CPU usage across different game systems
3. Monitor memory allocation and garbage collection
4. Profile GPU usage for rendering operations
5. Use frame time analysis to identify slow frames

## Maintaining Documentation

Documentation should be kept up to date as the codebase evolves. When making significant changes to the code:

1. Update relevant API documentation
2. Revise architectural descriptions if necessary
3. Update user guides for new features
4. Add troubleshooting entries for new potential issues
